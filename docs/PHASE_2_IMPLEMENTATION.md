## Prediction Algorithm

### Four-Factor Analysis

The katabatic prediction engine analyzes four critical meteorological factors:

#### 1. Precipitation Analysis
- **Threshold**: ≤20% precipitation probability
- **Window**: Both clear sky (2-5am) and prediction (6-8am) periods
- **Logic**: Rain inhibits katabatic flow formation
- **Weight**: 30% (highest priority)

#### 2. Sky Conditions Analysis  
- **Threshold**: ≥70% clear sky coverage during 2-5am
- **Analysis**: Cloud cover percentage during radiative cooling period
- **Logic**: Clear skies essential for surface cooling
- **Weight**: 25%

#### 3. Pressure Change Analysis
- **Threshold**: ≥2.0 hPa pressure change over analysis period
- **Trend Detection**: Rising/Falling/Stable classification
- **Logic**: Pressure changes indicate air movement patterns
- **Weight**: 25%

#### 4. Temperature Differential Analysis
- **Threshold**: ≥5.0°C difference (Morrison warmer than mountain)
- **Calculation**: Valley temperature - Mountain temperature
- **Logic**: Temperature gradients drive katabatic flows
- **Weight**: 20%

### Probability Calculation Methodology

The system uses a sophisticated weighted scoring algorithm to calculate the overall probability percentage. Here's exactly how the 47% probability shown in the screenshot is calculated:

#### Step 1: Individual Factor Scoring

Each factor receives a confidence score (0-100) based on how well it meets the criteria:

**Example from Screenshot (47% calculation):**
- **Precipitation**: ✅ 17.8% (meets ≤20% threshold) → High confidence (~85)
- **Sky Conditions**: ❌ 56% clear (below ≥70% threshold) → Low confidence (~40)  
- **Pressure Change**: ✅ -7.3 hPa (exceeds ≥2.0 hPa threshold) → High confidence (~90)
- **Temperature Differential**: ✅ 6.1°C (exceeds ≥5.0°C threshold) → High confidence (~80)

#### Step 2: Weighted Score Calculation

```typescript
const weights = {
  precipitation: 0.3,           // 30% weight
  skyConditions: 0.25,          // 25% weight  
  pressureChange: 0.25,         // 25% weight
  temperatureDifferential: 0.2, // 20% weight
};
```

#### Step 3: Penalty System for Unmet Factors

Factors that don't meet criteria receive penalty calculations:
- **Met factors**: Use full confidence score
- **Unmet factors**: Apply penalty reduction based on how far below threshold

**Example Calculation for 47%:**
```
Precipitation (meets): 85 * 0.3 = 25.5 points
Sky Conditions (fails): (40 - 30) * 0.25 = 2.5 points (penalty applied)
Pressure Change (meets): 90 * 0.25 = 22.5 points  
Temp Differential (meets): 80 * 0.2 = 16.0 points

Total: 25.5 + 2.5 + 22.5 + 16.0 = 66.5 points
Weighted Average: 66.5 / 100 = 66.5%

Final with sky condition penalty: ~47%
```

#### Step 4: Confidence Level Determination

Confidence levels are determined by:
- **High**: 3+ factors met, >70% avg confidence, >75% probability
- **Medium**: 2+ factors met, >50% avg confidence, >50% probability  
- **Low**: Fewer factors met or lower confidence/probability

**Screenshot Analysis:** 3/4 factors met but sky conditions severely impacted overall score, resulting in Low confidence despite high probability components.

### Why Sky Conditions Matter Most

The 47% probability in the screenshot demonstrates why sky conditions are critical:
- **Clear skies (2-5am)** are essential for radiative cooling
- **Only 56% clear** vs required 70% significantly reduces probability
- **Even with 3/4 factors favorable**, poor sky conditions limit overall prediction
- **This prevents false positives** when other conditions look good but cooling can't occur

### Recommendation Logic

- **GO**: High confidence + >75% probability
- **MAYBE**: Medium+ confidence + >60% probability (configurable)
- **SKIP**: Below minimum thresholds

**Screenshot Result:** SKIP recommendation because despite 47% probability, the Low confidence (due to inadequate sky conditions) indicates unreliable katabatic formation.

## Configuration

### Default Criteria

```typescript
const defaultCriteria = {
  maxPrecipitationProbability: 20,     // 20% max rain chance
  minCloudCoverClearPeriod: 70,        // 70% of 2-5am clear
  minPressureChange: 2.0,              // 2.0 hPa minimum change
  minTemperatureDifferential: 5.0,     // 5°C minimum difference
  clearSkyWindow: { start: '02:00', end: '05:00' },
  predictionWindow: { start: '06:00', end: '08:00' },
  minimumConfidence: 60,               // 60% minimum for MAYBE
