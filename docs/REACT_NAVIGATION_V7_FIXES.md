# React Navigation v7 Compatibility Fixes

This document describes fixes for compatibility issues with React Navigation v7, particularly with older Android devices.

## `findLast` Polyfill Fix

### Problem Description

After upgrading to React Navigation v7, the app began crashing on some Android devices with the following error:

```
TypeError: n.routes.findLast is not a function. (In 'n.routes.findLast((function(n){return n.name===s.payload.name&&k===(null==b?void 0:b({params:n.params}))}))', 'n.routes.findLast' is undefined)
```

This occurred because React Navigation v7 uses the `Array.prototype.findLast()` method, which was introduced in ES2023 and is not available in older JavaScript engines used by some Android devices.

### Solution

We implemented a polyfill for `Array.prototype.findLast` (and `findLastIndex`) to ensure compatibility with all Android devices. The polyfill is loaded early in the app initialization process, before any navigation code runs.

The polyfill is located in `/services/polyfills.ts` and is imported at the top of `app/_layout.tsx` to ensure it's loaded before any other code runs.

### Implementation Details

1. Created a new file `services/polyfills.ts` with implementations for:
   - `Array.prototype.findLast`
   - `Array.prototype.findLastIndex`

2. Imported the polyfills at the top of our app entry point (`app/_layout.tsx`) to ensure they're available throughout the app

3. Updated the Android crash logger to specifically detect this type of error for better monitoring

### Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Build the app for an older Android device (API level â‰¤ 29)
2. Test navigation between screens, especially when using navigation state
3. Check the crash logs to ensure no `findLast is not a function` errors are occurring

### Additional Notes

- This polyfill should not affect performance or behavior on devices that already support these methods
- The polyfill implementation follows the ES2023 specification for `findLast` and `findLastIndex`
- If you encounter similar errors with other modern JavaScript features, consider adding additional polyfills to `services/polyfills.ts`
