# White Screen Fix - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes implemented to fix the white screen issue in the Wind Trend Analyzer Android app. The issue presented as the app briefly displaying content before crashing to a white screen.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Memory Management Issues**: 
   - Progressive memory growth and cache corruption
   - Inefficient state management causing React rendering issues

2. **Race Conditions**:
   - Component initialization race conditions
   - Unhandled async operations during critical rendering paths

3. **Error Boundary Limitations**:
   - Inadequate error recovery from specific error types
   - Insufficient cleanup during recovery attempts

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Memory Management

- Created `memoryManager.ts` service for proactive memory cleanup
- Added cache size monitoring and automatic trimming
- Implemented cleanup during app lifecycle transitions

```typescript
// Memory cleanup service example
export const performMemoryCleanup = async (aggressive: boolean = false): Promise<boolean> => {
  // Clean AsyncStorage keys that might cause issues
  // ...
};
```

### 2. Safer State Management

- Implemented `useStableState.ts` hook to prevent rendering race conditions
- Enhanced error handling in data display components
- Protected critical components with improved error boundaries

```typescript
// Stable state hook example
export function useStableState<T>(initialValue: T): [T, (value: T) => void] {
  // Provides more reliable state management
  // ...
}
```

### 3. Recovery System

- Created `recoveryService.ts` for granular recovery options
- Enhanced error boundary with data clearing capabilities
- Added emergency fallback data for critical failures

```typescript
// Recovery service example
export const recoverFromWhiteScreen = async (): Promise<boolean> => {
  // Targeted cleanup of problematic data
  // ...
};
```

### 4. Component Safety

- Added `SafeDataWrapper` for protecting data-heavy components
- Enhanced the critical `WindDataDisplay` component with error protection
- Added resource cleanup on component unmount

```typescript
// Component safety example
export function SafeDataWrapper<T>({ data, fallback, children }) {
  // Provides protection against rendering crashes
  // ...
}
```

### 5. Splash Screen Management

- Improved splash screen transitions with enhanced `androidSplash.ts`
- Added tiered safety fallbacks for splash screens
- Protected against initialization race conditions

```typescript
// Enhanced splash handling example
export const hideSplashScreen = async () => {
  // Multiple fallbacks and retry logic
  // ...
};
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Build and Install**: Test full app installation from GitHub Actions builds
2. **Background/Foreground Cycles**: Test app after multiple background/foreground transitions
3. **Memory Pressure**: Test under low memory conditions
4. **Recovery**: Test automatic recovery after simulated crashes

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing Firebase Crashlytics for better error reporting
2. Evaluate switching to EAS Build for more reliable Android builds
3. Consider adding a startup diagnostic check to proactively detect issues
