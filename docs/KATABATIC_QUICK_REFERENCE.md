# Quick Reference: Katabatic Wind Predictions

## Reading Your Prediction

### Probability Scale
- **75-100%** ðŸŸ¢ Excellent - GO!
- **50-74%** ðŸŸ¡ Good - Likely favorable
- **25-49%** ðŸŸ  Marginal - Mixed conditions  
- **0-24%** ðŸ”´ Poor - Stay home

### Confidence Levels
- **High** ðŸŸ¢ Very reliable prediction
- **Medium** ðŸŸ¡ Fairly reliable prediction
- **Low** ðŸ”´ Less reliable, proceed with caution

### Factor Checklist
âœ… **Rain**: <20% precipitation chance  
âœ… **Clear Sky**: >70% clear during 2-5am  
âœ… **Pressure**: >2.0 hPa pressure change  
âœ… **Temperature**: >9.0Â°F Morrison warmer than Nederland (1740m vs 2540m elevation)  

## Key Insights

### Why 47% with 3/4 Factors? 
**Sky conditions are critical!** Even with good rain, pressure, and temperature, poor radiative cooling (cloudy 2-5am) severely limits katabatic wind formation.

### Factor Importance
1. **Sky Conditions** - Controls nighttime cooling
2. **Precipitation** - Disrupts all wind patterns  
3. **Pressure Change** - Indicates air movement
4. **Temperature Diff** - Provides driving force

### Best Conditions
- Clear, cold nights after weather fronts
- High pressure systems
- Strong temperature inversions
- Post-sunset cooling periods

## Quick Tips
- **Trust high confidence** predictions regardless of percentage
- **Be cautious with low confidence** even if percentage looks good
- **Sky conditions matter most** for reliable katabatic formation
- **Check updates frequently** - conditions change rapidly
