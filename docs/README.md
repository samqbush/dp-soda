## Documentation Maintenance

### Recent Reorganization (June 7, 2025)

This documentation was recently reorganized to eliminate sprawl and improve accessibility:

**Before**: 15+ scattered documentation files with overlapping content
**After**: 8 focused guides with clear purposes and cross-references

**Archived Files**: Old documentation moved to `archive/` directory for reference
**New Structure**: Logical organization by user type (users, developers, operations)

### Keeping Documentation Current

- **Update with code changes**: Modify relevant docs when implementing features
- **Cross-reference updates**: Update related guides when changing one file
- **User feedback**: Incorporate feedback to improve clarity and completeness
- **Version documentation**: Note significant changes and update timestamps

## Getting Help

- **Issues**: Report bugs via GitHub Issues
- **Questions**: Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) first
- **Contributing**: See [Developer Setup](developer-setup.md) for contribution guidelines
- **Feature Requests**: Submit through GitHub Issues with detailed descriptions

## Archive

Historical documentation is preserved in the `archive/` directory:
- Previous architecture documents
- Legacy setup guides  
- Feature-specific documentation
- Build and deployment archives

These files remain available for reference but are no longer actively maintained.
