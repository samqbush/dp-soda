# Wind Guru Enhancement Plan: MKI Integration

## Overview
Based on the Mountain Wave-Katabatic Flow Interaction (MKI) research, this plan outlines enhancements to the Wind Guru prediction system to incorporate advanced atmospheric science.

## Current System Analysis

### Strengths
- 4-factor analysis system (Precipitation, Sky Conditions, Pressure, Temperature) 
- Confidence calculation with factor weighting
- Real-time verification and learning
- User-friendly presentation with probability and recommendations

### Limitations Identified from MKI Research
1. **Missing Mountain Wave Analysis**: No consideration of synoptic flow patterns and Froude number effects
2. **Single-Scale Pressure Analysis**: Only looks at surface pressure, missing wave-induced pressure modifications
3. **Static Stability Assessment**: No evaluation of atmospheric stability profile for wave propagation
4. **Limited Temporal Variability**: Doesn't account for microscale (rapid) and mesoscale (hourly) variations
5. **No Wave-Flow Coupling**: Missing the interaction between high-altitude waves and surface katabatic flow

## Enhancement Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Data Collection (Immediate)
**Objective**: Gather additional meteorological data needed for MKI analysis

**Implementation**:
1. **Synoptic Wind Data**: Collect upper-level wind speed and direction (2-4km altitude)
2. **Atmospheric Stability**: Calculate Brunt-Väisälä frequency and stability profile
3. **Froude Number**: Compute Fr = U/NH for mountain wave assessment
4. **Multi-level Temperature**: Get temperature profiles for stability analysis
5. **Enhanced Pressure Data**: Higher temporal resolution pressure measurements

**Data Sources**:
- OpenWeatherMap: Upper-level winds, atmospheric profiles
- NOAA Models: Stability indices, wave propagation potential
- Local Weather Stations: High-frequency pressure measurements

### Phase 2: MKI Factor Integration (Short-term: 2-3 weeks)
**Objective**: Add the two new factors to the prediction system

**Implementation**:
1. **Wave Pattern Factor** (Factor #5)
   - Calculate Froude number from synoptic conditions
   - Assess wave amplitude and organization potential
   - Evaluate surface coupling probability
   - Score based on optimal Fr ranges (0.4-0.6)

2. **Atmospheric Stability Factor** (Factor #6)
   - Analyze stability profile from surface to wave propagation levels
   - Assess surface stability for katabatic development
   - Evaluate mid-level stability for wave propagation
   - Score based on multi-layer stability optimization

**Algorithm Updates**:
- Expand factor weighting system to 6 factors
- Adjust confidence calculations for additional complexity
- Update recommendation logic for MKI scenarios

### Phase 3: Advanced Prediction Logic (Medium-term: 1-2 months)
**Objective**: Implement sophisticated MKI interaction modeling

**Implementation**:
1. **Multi-scale Variability Modeling**
   - **Mesoscale (Hourly)**: Track mountain wave system evolution
   - **Microscale (Minutes)**: Account for wave breaking and rapid fluctuations
   - **Adaptive Time Windows**: Adjust prediction windows based on wave activity

2. **Enhanced Pressure Analysis**
   - **Synoptic Gradients**: Large-scale pressure patterns
   - **Wave-Induced Modifications**: Pressure changes from mountain wave effects
   - **Local Variations**: Microscale pressure fluctuations from wave breaking

3. **Coupling Efficiency Calculation**
   - Assess how effectively high-altitude waves influence surface flow
   - Model wave energy transmission to surface levels
   - Predict enhancement vs. disruption scenarios

### Phase 4: Advanced UI/UX (Long-term: 2-3 months)
**Objective**: Present complex MKI information in user-friendly format

**Implementation**:
1. **Enhanced Factor Display**
   - Visual representation of all 6 factors
   - MKI-specific explanations and insights
   - Wave pattern visualization (when beneficial)

2. **Advanced Prediction Windows**
   - Multiple time windows based on wave evolution
   - "Wave-enhanced periods" vs. "standard katabatic windows"
   - Real-time wave activity indicators

3. **Activity-Specific MKI Guidance**
   - Customized recommendations for different wind sports
   - Wave-induced safety considerations
   - Optimal timing suggestions based on MKI patterns

  wavePropagationPotential: number; // 0-100
}

// services/atmosphericStabilityAnalyzer.ts

```

### Enhanced Factor Calculation

```typescript
// New factor scoring with MKI integration
const calculateWavePatternFactor = (
  synopticWind: number,
  stability: number,
  terrainHeight: number
): WavePatternScore => {
  const froudeNumber = synopticWind / (stability * terrainHeight);
  
  if (froudeNumber >= 0.4 && froudeNumber <= 0.6) {
    return { score: 100, explanation: 'Optimal wave enhancement' };
  } else if (froudeNumber >= 0.3 && froudeNumber <= 0.7) {
    return { score: 75, explanation: 'Good wave conditions' };
  } else if (froudeNumber >= 0.2 && froudeNumber <= 0.8) {
    return { score: 50, explanation: 'Marginal wave activity' };
  } else {
    return { score: 0, explanation: 'Poor wave conditions' };
  }
};
```

## Success Metrics

### Prediction Accuracy Improvement
- **Target**: Increase overall prediction accuracy by 15-25%
- **Measure**: Comparison of prediction vs. actual conditions
- **Focus**: Reduce false negatives (missed good conditions due to MKI enhancement)

### User Experience Enhancement
- **Target**: Maintain or improve ease of use despite increased complexity
- **Measure**: User feedback and engagement metrics
- **Focus**: Clear explanations of when MKI effects are significant

### Edge Case Handling
- **Target**: Better predictions during marginal conditions
- **Measure**: Accuracy during low-confidence periods
- **Focus**: Identify when wave enhancement might overcome poor basic conditions

## Risk Mitigation

### Complexity Management
- **Phase Implementation**: Gradual rollout to avoid overwhelming users
- **A/B Testing**: Compare enhanced vs. current predictions
- **Fallback Options**: Maintain simple view for users who prefer it

### Data Quality
- **Multiple Sources**: Use redundant data sources for critical calculations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when advanced data unavailable
- **Validation**: Cross-check new predictions against known good conditions

### Performance Considerations
- **Caching**: Store complex calculations to avoid repeated computation
- **Background Processing**: Perform heavy MKI analysis asynchronously
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic predictions load first, MKI analysis follows

This plan transforms the Wind Guru from a basic 4-factor system into a sophisticated MKI-aware prediction engine while maintaining usability and reliability.
