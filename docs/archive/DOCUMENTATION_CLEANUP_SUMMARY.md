# Documentation Cleanup Summary - June 10, 2025

## Overview
Successfully consolidated scattered documentation files throughout the Dawn Patrol Alarm repository into a organized structure within the `docs/` directory.

## Files Relocated

### Moved to `docs/archive/` (Historical Development Documentation)
- `ALGORITHM_CALIBRATION_PHASE_2B.md` - Phase 2B katabatic algorithm improvements
- `ALGORITHM_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` - Original algorithm improvement planning
- `CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md` - Previous cleanup activities log
- `PREDICTION_SYNC_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Wind Guru prediction synchronization fix
- `TEST_PREDICTION_SYNC_FIX.md` - Test plan for prediction sync fix  
- `WIND_GURU_TIME_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Time-based analysis fix for Wind Guru

### Moved to `docs/` (Active Documentation)
- `scripts/README-device-debug.md` → `docs/device-debug-script.md`

### Files That Remained in Place
- `README.md` (root) - Main project documentation
- `.github/prompts/*.md` - GitHub Copilot prompt files
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - GitHub Copilot configuration
- `.github/instructions/*.md` - GitHub-specific instructions

## Improvements Made

### 1. Archive Organization
- Created `docs/archive/` directory for historical documentation
- Added comprehensive `docs/archive/README.md` explaining archive contents
- Preserved all historical development context while cleaning up active documentation

### 2. Documentation Structure Enhancement
- Updated `docs/README.md` with new file references
- Added "Development Tools" section for utility scripts
- Improved cross-referencing between documentation files
- Updated timestamps to reflect current reorganization

### 3. Root Directory Cleanup
- Reduced root directory from 6+ scattered .md files to just `README.md`
- Eliminated documentation sprawl while preserving important information
- Maintained clean project structure

### 4. Link Validation
- Verified all internal documentation links work correctly
- Fixed broken reference to non-existent CI/CD secrets guide
- Updated main README.md to reflect new organization

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers can now easily find relevant documentation
2. **Improved Maintenance**: Clear separation between active and historical documentation
3. **Better Organization**: Logical grouping by purpose and audience
4. **Preserved History**: All development context maintained in accessible archive
5. **Clean Repository**: Professional appearance with organized file structure

## Impact
- **Before**: 15+ scattered .md files across multiple directories
- **After**: Consolidated structure with clear organization and purpose
- **Maintained**: All historical development context and cross-references
- **Improved**: Documentation discoverability and maintenance

This cleanup eliminates documentation sprawl while preserving valuable development history and improving the overall developer experience.
