## Why These Were Archived

The original documentation structure had several issues:
- **Documentation sprawl**: 15+ files with overlapping content
- **Poor discoverability**: Hard for newcomers to find relevant information
- **Maintenance burden**: Updates required changes to multiple files
- **Inconsistent organization**: No clear structure for different user types

## New Structure Benefits

The consolidated documentation provides:
- **Clear entry points** for different user types (users, developers, operations)
- **Comprehensive guides** that cover complete workflows
- **Better cross-referencing** between related topics
- **Easier maintenance** with less duplication

## Accessing Archived Content

If you need specific information from these archived files:

1. **Check the new documentation first** - the content was reorganized, not deleted
2. **Use file search** to find specific topics across the new guides
3. **Reference these files directly** if you need the original structure
4. **Create an issue** if important information was missed in the consolidation
