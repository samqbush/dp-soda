## Recent Improvements

### Wind Data Chart Enhancements (Latest)

**Key Improvements Made:**
- ✅ **Eliminated data gaps** by implementing combined historical + real-time API approach
- ✅ **Improved chart UX** with CustomWindChart component featuring:
  - Professional time-based x-axis labeling (hourly with AM/PM, quarter-hour marks)
  - Horizontal scrolling with sticky Y-axis labels
  - Proper gap handling (line breaks for missing data)
  - Dynamic width based on data range
- ✅ **Streamlined refresh UX** - removed refresh button, now pull-to-refresh only
- ✅ **Optimized performance** - auto-refresh only on first navigation to tabs
- ✅ **Better data freshness** - shows current time coverage and last updated timestamp

**Technical Changes:**
- **ecowittService.ts**: Added `fetchEcowittCombinedWindDataForDevice()` combining historical and real-time APIs
- **CustomWindChart.tsx**: SVG-based chart replacing legacy React Native Chart Kit implementation  
- **Removed unused components**: VictoryWindChart, legacy WindChart
- **Cleaned debug scripts**: Removed 20+ temporary investigation scripts

**Data Coverage Solution:**
- Historical API provides data from start of day up to ~10:20am
- Real-time API provides current conditions and recent data
- Combined approach eliminates the 7am-1pm data gap issue

## Wind Data Gap Investigation (Resolved)

### Issue
Large gaps appeared in wind data charts between 7AM-1PM, despite Ecowitt web UI showing data for those periods.

### Investigation Results
Comprehensive API testing with multiple parameters, timezones, and cycle types revealed:

**✅ Root Cause Confirmed**: Gaps exist in the raw Ecowitt API data itself, not in app processing.

**Key Findings**:
- API returns 130 total data points but with consistent gaps:
  - GAP 1: 07:00 AM → 08:25 AM (85 minutes)
  - GAP 2: 08:35 AM → 11:40 AM (185 minutes) ← Main visible gap
  - GAP 3: 04:20 PM → 05:00 PM (40 minutes)
- Same gaps appear across all test scenarios (different timezones, cycle types, parameters)
- Even when requesting ONLY 7AM-1PM data, API returns the same internal gaps
- Real-time API works but only provides current moment, not historical gap-filling

**Conclusion**: The weather station itself had data collection/transmission issues during these periods. The Ecowitt web UI may show interpolated or cached data that the API doesn't provide.

### Solution
**Accepted as normal behavior** for historical weather APIs. The app correctly processes all available data.

**Current Implementation**:
- Uses `fetchEcowittCombinedWindDataForDevice()` for historical + real-time data
- CustomWindChart properly displays gaps with line breaks (no false interpolation)
- Professional chart with proper time labeling and horizontal scrolling

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

1. **Follow TypeScript best practices**
   - Use proper type annotations
   - Avoid `any` types when possible
   - Define interfaces for complex objects

2. **Component Structure**
   ```typescript
   // Good component structure
   interface ComponentProps {
     // Define props with types
   }
   
   export function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) {
     // Hooks at the top
     const [state, setState] = useState();
     
     // Event handlers
     const handleAction = () => {
       // Handler logic
     };
     
     // Render
     return (
       // JSX here
     );
   }
   ```

3. **File Organization**
   - One component per file
   - Use descriptive file names
   - Group related files in directories

### API Integration

1. **Use the weatherService abstraction**
   ```typescript
   // Good - use the service
   import { weatherService } from '@/services/weatherService';
   
   // Bad - direct API calls in components
   ```

2. **Handle errors gracefully**
   ```typescript
   try {
     const data = await weatherService.getCurrentWeather();
     // Handle success
   } catch (error) {
     // Handle error with user-friendly message
   }
   ```

3. **Implement proper loading states**
   ```typescript
   const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
   const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
   ```

### Android-Specific Considerations

1. **Use Android-safe wrappers** for crash-prone components
2. **Test on physical devices** - emulators may not catch all issues
3. **Implement proper error boundaries** for crash recovery
4. **Use debugging components** when troubleshooting Android issues

## Evening Weather Refresh Service

The app includes an automatic evening weather refresh system that ensures accurate overnight wind predictions.

### Purpose
The evening refresh service solves the issue where pressure change and temperature differential would show 0.0 values when the app transitions from afternoon to evening analysis mode at 6 PM.

### How It Works
1. **Automatic Scheduling**: Service schedules a background notification for 6 PM daily
2. **Silent Refresh**: At 6 PM, weather data is automatically refreshed in the background
3. **Fresh Data**: Ensures pressure trends and temperature differentials are calculated with current data
4. **User Transparency**: Status is visible in the Wind Guru screen header

### Key Files
- `services/generalNotificationService.ts` - General purpose notification system
- `services/eveningWeatherRefreshService.ts` - Main service implementation
- `services/alarmNotificationService.ts` - Alarm-specific notifications (separate from general)
- `app/(tabs)/wind-guru.tsx` - UI status display

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test the evening refresh service
npm run debug-evening-refresh

# Check current status and trigger manual refresh
node scripts/debug-evening-refresh.mjs
```

### Configuration
The service automatically initializes when the app starts and requires notification permissions to function properly. No additional configuration is needed.

## Prediction Lifecycle Management

The app implements a robust prediction lifecycle management system to ensure wind predictions are locked at appropriate times and maintain consistency throughout the prediction window.

### Purpose
The prediction lifecycle management solves timing issues where predictions would dramatically change after midnight due to forecast data transitions. It implements a structured approach to prediction reliability:

### Lifecycle Stages
1. **Preview (Morning-Evening)**: Predictions calculated normally, updated with fresh data
2. **Evening Lock (6 PM)**: First lock point - prediction locked for evening review
3. **Final Lock (11 PM)**: Second lock point - prediction locked for dawn execution
4. **Active (Midnight-8 AM)**: Locked prediction used, no recalculation
5. **Verification (8 AM)**: Compare predicted vs actual conditions

### Key Features
- **Automatic Locking**: Predictions automatically lock at 6 PM and 11 PM
- **State Persistence**: Locked predictions saved and restored between app sessions
- **Consistent Results**: Same prediction shown from evening through dawn
- **Verification**: Post-event analysis to improve prediction accuracy

### Key Files
- `services/predictionStateManager.ts` - Core prediction lifecycle management
- `services/katabaticAnalyzer.ts` - Integrated prediction analysis with state management

### Testing
```bash
# Debug current prediction state and real wind data
npm run debug-stations  # Shows real wind data for verification
```

### Configuration
The prediction lifecycle system automatically initializes when first accessed and requires no manual configuration. It uses AsyncStorage for persistence and includes automatic cleanup of old predictions.
