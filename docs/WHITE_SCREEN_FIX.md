# White Screen Fix for Wind Trend Analyzer Android App

## Problem Description

The app exhibited a white screen issue on Android after briefly showing content. This pattern suggests that the app was initializing correctly but then encountering an error during or after initialization that wasn't being caught by the error boundary.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Memory Management Issues**:
   - Potential memory leaks or excessive cache growth causing crashes
   - Cache corruption during app updates or when AsyncStorage data format changes

2. **Race Conditions**:
   - Unhandled timing issues during app initialization
   - Wind data fetching conflicts with UI initialization

3. **Error Recovery Limitations**:
   - Error boundary not effectively handling certain types of errors
   - Insufficient data clearing during recovery attempts

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Memory Management Improvements

- Created a memory manager service (`memoryManager.ts`) for proactive cache cleanup
- Added cache size monitoring with automatic trimming
- Implemented aggressive cleanup during app startup on Android
- Added background/foreground transition cleanup

### 2. State Management Enhancements

- Created a stable state hook (`useStableState.ts`) to prevent race conditions
- Enhanced the Wind Data hook to use more robust state management
- Added reference tracking to prevent closure issues
- Added timeout protection for all async operations

### 3. Recovery System Overhaul

- Created a dedicated recovery service (`recoveryService.ts`)
- Implemented tiered recovery strategies (basic â†’ aggressive)
- Enhanced error boundary with improved data clearing
- Added emergency fallback data for critical failures
- Protected app state during background/foreground transitions

### 4. Android-Specific Optimizations

- Enhanced `AndroidSafeWrapper` with deeper recovery capabilities
- Added component render tracking to detect stuck states
- Improved splash screen management and transition
- Sequential resource loading to prevent initialization race conditions

## Testing & Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. Build the app using GitHub Actions workflow
2. Install the generated .apk on an Android device
3. Monitor for white screen issues during startup
4. Put the app in background and return after 30+ minutes
5. Check recovery from memory-intensive operations

## Future Improvements

- Consider implementing Firebase Crashlytics for better error reporting
- Evaluate migrating to Expo EAS Build for more reliable Android builds
- Add proactive analytics to detect potential white screen conditions
- Implement a system to track and report AsyncStorage usage patterns
