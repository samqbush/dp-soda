# Wind Data Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implemented Features

### Core Services
- **Wind Data Services**
  - Fetches data from WindAlert API (endpoint: Bear Creek Lake/Soda Lake Dam 1)
  - Converts kph to mph and processes data
  - Analyzes 3am-5am alarm window and 6am-8am verification window
  - Configurable alarm criteria with sensible defaults
  - Offline caching with AsyncStorage and fallback data
  - Error handling and recovery mechanisms

### React Integration
- **Custom React Hooks**
  - Wind data state management with useWindData hook
  - Theme management with dark/light mode support
  - Automatic data refresh and caching
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages

### User Interface
- **Main Display Components**
  - Wind status indicator (Wake Up! ðŸŒŠ or Sleep In ðŸ˜´)
  - Key metrics dashboard: speed, consistency, consecutive points
  - Wind trend visualization chart showing 12-hour history
  - Manual refresh and data management
  - Configurable settings interface
  - Dark mode support throughout the application

### Android Crash & White Screen Prevention
- **Enhanced Crash Detection & Recovery**
  - Multi-layer crash detection system
  - White screen prevention mechanisms
  - Progressive recovery system with timeout escalation
  - Emergency recovery options for critical failures
  - Crash reporting and diagnostic tools

- **Developer Mode & Debug Tools**
  - Secret gesture activation (tap pattern on specific UI elements)
  - Configurable debug component visibility
  - Android Crash Logger with detailed reports
  - APK Diagnostics for runtime testing
  - Enhanced Android Debugger with system monitoring
  - Quick Export button for emergency crash reports
  - Central settings UI for all debug features

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Matching Your Requirements

### âœ… Mobile App (Expo/React Native)
- Self-contained app (no backend required)
- Cross-platform iOS/Android support with specific Android optimizations
- Dark mode and modern UI with responsive design

### âœ… Data Handling
- Fetches data just before analysis (configurable timing)
- Focuses on 2am-8am window with 3am-5am alarm analysis
- Converts kph to mph as in original script
- Outputs structured data for visualization
- Robust error handling and fallback data

### âœ… Alarm Logic
- All criteria are user-configurable:
  - Minimum average wind speed (default: 10 mph)
  - Direction consistency (default: 70%)
  - Minimum consecutive good data points (default: 4)
  - Speed/direction deviation thresholds
- Verification logic for 6am-8am window
- Real-time re-analysis when settings change

### âœ… User Experience
- Clear visual indicators (ðŸŒŠ wake up, ðŸ˜´ sleep in)
- All settings easily discoverable and adjustable
- Manual refresh capability
- Offline access to last-fetched data
- Loading states and error handling

### âœ… Android-Specific Enhancements
- White screen prevention and detection
- Enhanced crash detection and recovery
- Diagnostic tools and crash reporting
- APK-specific optimizations
- Progressive recovery system

## ðŸš€ Ready for Future Enhancements

The modular architecture makes it easy to add:
- Push notifications
- Historical tracking
- Multiple locations
- Weather integration
- Advanced charts and visualizations

## ðŸ“± How to Use

1. **Start the app**: `npm start` or `npx expo start --tunnel` for public wifi testing
2. **View wind conditions**: Home screen shows current analysis
3. **Adjust settings**: Explore tab for configuration
4. **Test functionality**: WindDataTest component for debugging
5. **Run standalone**: `npm run fetch-wind` for independent data fetching
6. **Android build**: GitHub Actions workflow handles optimized Android builds

## ðŸ“Š Data Flow

1. **Fetch**: WindAlert API â†’ Raw JSON data
2. **Process**: Convert kph to mph, filter 24h window
3. **Cache**: Store in AsyncStorage for offline access
4. **Analyze**: Apply configurable criteria to 3am-5am window
5. **Verify**: Check 6am-8am window against prediction
6. **Display**: Show results with visual indicators and charts

## ðŸ”§ Crash Prevention & Recovery

1. **Detection**: Multi-level crash detection monitors app health
2. **Prevention**: Pre-emptive measures to avoid white screens
3. **Recovery**: Progressive system with increasingly powerful recovery options
4. **Diagnostics**: Runtime testing tools and crash reporting
5. **Emergency**: Last-resort options for critical failures
