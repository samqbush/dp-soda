  - Wind trend visualization chart showing 10-hour history
  - Manual refresh and data management
  - Configurable settings interface
  - Dark mode support throughout the application
  
- **Alarm Tester**
  - Interactive testing interface for wind alarm functionality
  - Pre-configured test scenarios (good conditions, weak winds, etc.)
  - Real-time parameter adjustment with immediate feedback
  - Audio testing with volume control and snooze functionality
  - Educational interface explaining alarm criteria and decisions

### Android Crash & White Screen Prevention
- **Enhanced Crash Detection & Recovery**
  - Multi-layer crash detection system
  - White screen prevention mechanisms
  - Progressive recovery system with timeout escalation
  - Emergency recovery options for critical failures
  - Crash reporting and diagnostic tools

- **Developer Mode & Debug Tools**
  - Secret gesture activation (tap pattern on specific UI elements)
  - Configurable debug component visibility
  - Android Crash Logger with detailed reports
  - APK Diagnostics for runtime testing
  - Enhanced Android Debugger with system monitoring
  - Quick Export button for emergency crash reports
  - Central settings UI for all debug features

## üéØ Key Features Matching Your Requirements

### ‚úÖ Mobile App (Expo/React Native)
- Self-contained app (no backend required)
- Cross-platform iOS/Android support with specific Android optimizations
- Dark mode and modern UI with responsive design

### ‚úÖ Data Handling
- Fetches data just before analysis (configurable timing)
- Focuses on 2am-10am window with 3am-5am alarm analysis
- Converts kph to mph as in original script
- Outputs structured data for visualization
- Robust error handling and fallback data

### ‚úÖ Alarm Logic
- All criteria are user-configurable:
  - Minimum average wind speed (default: 10 mph)
  - Direction consistency (default: 70%)
  - Minimum consecutive good data points (default: 4)
  - Direction deviation thresholds
- Verification logic for 6am-8am window
- Real-time re-analysis when settings change

### ‚úÖ User Experience
- Clear visual indicators (üåä wake up, üò¥ sleep in)
- All settings easily discoverable and adjustable
- Manual refresh capability
- Offline access to last-fetched data
- Loading states and error handling

### ‚úÖ Android-Specific Enhancements
- White screen prevention and detection
- Enhanced crash detection and recovery
- Diagnostic tools and crash reporting
- APK-specific optimizations
- Progressive recovery system

## üöÄ Ready for Future Enhancements

The modular architecture makes it easy to add:
- Push notifications
- Historical tracking
- Multiple locations
- Weather integration
- Advanced charts and visualizations

## üì± How to Use

1. **Start the app**: `npm start` or `npx expo start --tunnel` for public wifi testing
2. **View wind conditions**: Home screen shows current analysis
3. **Adjust settings**: Settings tab for configuration
4. **Test functionality**: WindDataTest component for debugging
5. **Run standalone**: `npm run fetch-wind` for independent data fetching
6. **Android build**: GitHub Actions workflow handles optimized Android builds

## üìä Data Flow

1. **Fetch**: WindAlert API ‚Üí Raw JSON data
2. **Process**: Convert kph to mph, filter 24h window
3. **Cache**: Store in AsyncStorage for offline access
4. **Analyze**: Apply configurable criteria to 3am-5am window
5. **Verify**: Check 6am-8am window against prediction
6. **Display**: Show results with visual indicators and charts

## üîß Crash Prevention & Recovery

1. **Detection**: Multi-level crash detection monitors app health
2. **Prevention**: Pre-emptive measures to avoid white screens
3. **Recovery**: Progressive system with increasingly powerful recovery options
4. **Diagnostics**: Runtime testing tools and crash reporting
5. **Emergency**: Last-resort options for critical failures

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Audio System Migration Required
- **Issue**: Currently using deprecated `expo-av` package for alarm audio (though `expo-audio` is installed)
- **Impact**: Will break in Expo SDK 54+ (current project uses SDK 53)
- **Solution**: Complete migration from `expo-av` to `expo-audio` package before upgrading to SDK 54
- **Files Affected**: `services/alarmAudioService.ts`, `hooks/useAlarmAudio.ts`
- **Status**: In progress - `expo-audio` dependency added, code migration needed
- **Priority**: High (blocking future SDK upgrades)

### Future Improvements
- **Push Notifications**: Planned integration for background alarm notifications
- **Historical Accuracy Tracking**: Track prediction accuracy over time
- **Location Expansion**: Support for additional wind monitoring locations
- **Offline Mode**: Enhanced offline capabilities with cached forecasts
