# Wind Data Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implemented Features

### Core Services
- **`windService.ts`** - Complete wind data fetching and analysis service
  - Fetches data from WindAlert API (same endpoint as your original script)
  - Converts kph to mph 
  - Analyzes 3am-5am alarm window and 6am-8am verification window
  - Configurable alarm criteria with sensible defaults
  - Offline caching with AsyncStorage
  - Error handling and fallback to cached data

### React Integration
- **`useWindData.ts`** - React hook for state management
  - Manages wind data, analysis, and loading states
  - Handles configuration persistence
  - Automatic data refresh and caching
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages

### User Interface
- **`WindDataDisplay.tsx`** - Main display component
  - Shows current alarm status (Wake Up! ðŸŒŠ or Sleep In ðŸ˜´)
  - Displays key metrics: speed, consistency, consecutive points
  - Manual refresh functionality
  - Shows verification results for 6am-8am window
  - Data info and last updated timestamp

- **`WindChart.tsx`** - Visual wind trend chart
  - Line chart showing wind speed and gusts over 12 hours
  - Statistics: max speed, average speed, max gust
  - Responsive design with theme support
  - Handles cases with insufficient data

- **Settings Screen** (`explore.tsx`) - Configuration interface
  - Adjust all alarm criteria in real-time
  - Reset to defaults functionality
  - Immediate re-analysis when settings change
  - Input validation and user feedback

### Development Tools
- **`WindDataTest.tsx`** - Testing component (can be removed for production)
  - Tests API connectivity
  - Validates data parsing and analysis
  - Console-style output for debugging

- **`fetch-wind-data.mjs`** - Standalone script
  - Can be run independently with `npm run fetch-wind`
  - Outputs JSON and CSV files
  - Console analysis results
  - Same functionality as your original script

### App Integration
- **Updated home screen** with wind monitoring focus
- **Settings screen** for configuration
- **Dark mode support** throughout
- **Offline functionality** with cached data

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Matching Your Requirements

### âœ… Mobile App (Expo/React Native)
- Self-contained app (no backend required)
- Cross-platform iOS/Android support
- Dark mode and modern UI

### âœ… Data Handling
- Fetches data just before analysis (configurable timing)
- Focuses on 2am-8am window with 3am-5am alarm analysis
- Converts kph to mph as in original script
- Outputs structured data for visualization

### âœ… Alarm Logic
- All criteria are user-configurable:
  - Minimum average wind speed (default: 10 mph)
  - Direction consistency (default: 70%)
  - Minimum consecutive good data points (default: 4)
  - Speed/direction deviation thresholds
- Verification logic for 6am-8am window
- Real-time re-analysis when settings change

### âœ… User Experience
- Clear visual indicators (ðŸŒŠ wake up, ðŸ˜´ sleep in)
- All settings easily discoverable and adjustable
- Manual refresh capability
- Offline access to last-fetched data
- Loading states and error handling

## ðŸš€ Ready for Future Enhancements

The modular architecture makes it easy to add:
- Push notifications
- Historical tracking
- Multiple locations
- Weather integration
- Advanced charts

## ðŸ“± How to Use

1. **Start the app**: `npm start`
2. **View wind conditions**: Home screen shows current analysis
3. **Adjust settings**: Explore tab for configuration
4. **Test functionality**: WindDataTest component for debugging
5. **Run standalone**: `npm run fetch-wind` for independent data fetching

## ðŸ“Š Data Flow

1. **Fetch**: WindAlert API â†’ Raw JSON data
2. **Process**: Convert kph to mph, filter 24h window
3. **Cache**: Store in AsyncStorage for offline access
4. **Analyze**: Apply configurable criteria to 3am-5am window
5. **Verify**: Check 6am-8am window against prediction
6. **Display**: Show results with visual indicators and charts

The implementation follows your original script's approach while adding mobile-optimized features and user configurability.
