  - Visual crash status indicator (top-right corner)
  - Real-time crash display
  - Export crash logs functionality
  - Clear crash history
  - Android-specific implementation

### 4. APK Crash Diagnostics Tool
- **File**: `components/ApkCrashDiagnostics.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - System health checks
  - AsyncStorage testing
  - Memory allocation testing
  - Network API testing
  - React Native API testing
  - Automatic failure detection

### 5. Enhanced App Layout
- **File**: `app/_layout.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Initialize production crash detector
  - Add crash logger component
  - Add diagnostics component
  - Enhanced error boundary setup

### 6. Build Script for APK Testing
- **File**: `scripts/build-debug-apk.sh`
- **Features**:
  - Automated APK building with crash detection
  - Pre-build checks
  - APK size reporting
  - Installation instructions
  - Debug feature documentation

### 7. User Action Logging
- **Files**: Multiple components
- **Changes**:
  - Log key user interactions
  - Track data refresh attempts
  - Monitor component loading
  - Capture error contexts

### 8. Comprehensive Documentation
- **File**: `docs/APK_CRASH_DEBUGGING.md`
- **Content**:
  - Complete troubleshooting guide
  - Testing procedures
  - Common crash causes and solutions
  - Recovery strategies

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Build and Test APK
```bash
# Make script executable (if not already done)
chmod +x ./scripts/build-debug-apk.sh

# Build APK with crash detection
./scripts/build-debug-apk.sh
```

### 2. Install on Android Device
1. Transfer the generated APK to your Android device
2. Enable "Unknown sources" in device settings
3. Install the APK
4. Launch the app

### 3. Debug Crashes
1. **Look for debug tools** in the top-right corner:
   - üö® **Crash Logger**: Red/orange/green circle
   - üîß **Diagnostics**: Blue circle with test status

2. **If app crashes immediately**:
   - Reinstall the APK
   - Wait 10-15 seconds for crash detection to activate
   - Look for debug UI elements

3. **Using the Crash Logger**:
   - Tap the colored circle to view crash history
   - Use "Export Logs" to share crash data
   - Review user actions before crashes

4. **Using Diagnostics**:
   - Tap "Run Tests" to check system health
   - Review failed tests for root cause
   - Export diagnostic report

## üîç Debug Indicators

### Crash Logger Status Colors:
- üü¢ **Green**: No crashes detected
- üü† **Orange**: Some crashes detected
- üî¥ **Red**: Multiple crashes detected

### Diagnostic Status:
- üîß **"X Pass"**: All tests passing
- üîß **"X Fail"**: Some tests failing (click to see details)
- üîß **"Test"**: No tests run yet

## üìä What to Look For

### Common Crash Patterns:
1. **Immediate crash on startup**: Usually AsyncStorage or memory issues
2. **Crash during data loading**: Network or JSON processing issues
3. **Crash after user interaction**: Component rendering or state issues
4. **White screen**: React rendering or initialization problems

### Key Data Points:
- **Error messages**: What specifically failed
- **User actions**: What the user was doing when it crashed
- **Diagnostic results**: Which system tests failed
- **Platform info**: Android version and device details

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

### If Crashes Persist:
1. **Export all crash data** using the tools
2. **Run diagnostics** and note failures
3. **Check the troubleshooting guide** in `docs/APK_CRASH_DEBUGGING.md`
4. **Try recovery options** (clear app data, reinstall)

### For Development:
1. **Test on multiple Android devices** if possible
2. **Monitor crash patterns** over time
3. **Use the enhanced error boundaries** to catch issues early
4. **Keep the debugging tools enabled** during testing

## üì± Expected Behavior

### Normal Operation:
- App launches successfully
- Wind data loads and displays
- Refresh functionality works
- No crash logger alerts
- All diagnostic tests pass

### With Enhanced Debugging:
- Crash detection runs in background
- User actions are logged automatically
- Failures are captured and stored
- Recovery UI appears for frequent crashes
- Debug tools are always accessible

## üîß Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### If APK won't install:
- Check Android "Unknown sources" setting
- Ensure sufficient storage space
- Try uninstalling previous version first

### If app shows white screen:
- Wait 15 seconds for crash detection
- Look for debug buttons in corners
- Try force-closing and reopening app

### If no debug tools visible:
- App may have crashed before tools loaded
- Try reinstalling APK
- Check if running on Android (tools are Android-only)

This implementation provides comprehensive crash detection and debugging capabilities specifically designed to help you identify and fix the Android APK crash issues you're experiencing.
