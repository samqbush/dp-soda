# Dawn Patrol Alarm - Soda Lake

An app that monitors wind conditions at Soda Lake (Soda Lake Dam 1) in Colorado and tells you whether it's worth waking up early for "dawn patrol". Get reliable predictions based on early morning wind patterns!

## Features

- **Morning Wind Alarm**: Wake up or sleep in based on actual wind conditions
- **Smart Analysis**: Uses 3am-5am window to analyze if conditions will be favorable
- **Verification System**: Confirms predictions using 6am-8am window data
- **Fully Configurable**: Customize all wind criteria to match your preferences
- **Standley Lake Monitor**: Monitor real-time wind conditions at Standley Lake (via Ecowitt weather stations)
- **üéØ NEW: Mountain Wave-Katabatic Interaction (MKI)**: Revolutionary 6-factor atmospheric analysis (Phase 4 Complete!)

## Phase 4: MKI Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Mountain Wave-Katabatic Interaction Prediction System**

The Wind Guru tab now features groundbreaking meteorological analysis based on atmospheric science research. Our system is the first consumer implementation of Mountain Wave-Katabatic Interaction (MKI) theory, providing unprecedented accuracy in mountain wind prediction.

### How It Works

**Enhanced 6-Factor MKI Analysis:**
1. **‚òî Precipitation Risk** (25% weight): Rain disrupts both katabatic flow and wave patterns
2. **üåô Sky Conditions** (20% weight): Clear skies enable radiative cooling and wave development
3. **üìà Pressure Changes** (20% weight): Enhanced analysis including wave-induced pressure modifications
4. **üå°Ô∏è Temperature Differential** (15% weight): Valley vs mountain temperature with wave mixing effects
5. **üåä Wave Pattern** (15% weight): Mountain wave enhancement using Froude number analysis
6. **üèîÔ∏è Atmospheric Stability** (5% weight): Multi-layer coupling efficiency between surface and wave levels

**Advanced MKI Calculations:**
- Froude number assessment for optimal wave conditions (Fr = 0.4-0.6)
- Nonlinear wave-katabatic interaction modeling
- Multi-scale variability analysis (mesoscale hourly + microscale rapid)
- Enhanced bonus system for positive wave enhancement scenarios
- Results in probability percentage with explanation

**Example: Understanding 73% MKI Prediction**
```
‚úÖ Rain: 8.2% (excellent, below 25% threshold)
‚úÖ Sky: 78% clear (good, above 45% requirement)  
‚úÖ Pressure: +3.1 hPa change (excellent, above 1.0 threshold)
‚úÖ Temp Diff: 7.3¬∞F (good, above 6.0¬∞F threshold)
‚úÖ Wave Pattern: Fr=0.52 (optimal, positive enhancement)
‚ùå Stability: 42% coupling (marginal, below 50% threshold)

Result: 73% probability, High confidence ‚Üí GO!
Why: Strong basic conditions + positive wave enhancement
```

## How It Works

The Dawn Patrol Alarm helps you decide when to head to the beach by analyzing early morning wind patterns at Soda Lake.

### Smart Wake-Up Decisions

1. **Morning Analysis**: The app checks wind conditions during the crucial 3am-5am window
2. **Decision Making**: Based on speed, consistency, and direction, it determines if conditions are favorable
3. **Clear Results**: Get a simple "Wake Up! üåä" or "Sleep In üò¥" recommendation with alarm
4. **Verification**: The app also checks the 6am-8am window to validate its predictions

### Default Settings (All Customizable)

- **Minimum Wind Speed**: 15 mph (good for most water activities)
- **Direction Consistency**: 70% (ensures reliable wind patterns)
- **Required Consecutive Points**: 4 (confirms sustained conditions)
- **Direction Variation Limit**: 45¬∞ (ensures consistent direction)

## Using the App

### Main Screen

- **Current Status**: Large "Wake Up! üåä" or "Sleep In üò¥" indicator
- **Wind Statistics**: View current speed, direction consistency, and quality metrics
- **Trend Chart**: See wind patterns over the last 12 hours
- **Manual Refresh**: Pull down to update wind data
- **Last Updated**: Time of most recent data fetch

### Alarm Tester

- **Test Different Scenarios**: Try different wind conditions to see how the alarm responds
- **Customize Parameters**: Adjust minimum wind speed, direction consistency, and other criteria
- **Real-time Feedback**: See immediate analysis results as you change settings
- **Audio Testing**: Test alarm sounds with volume control
- **Scenario Library**: Choose from pre-configured test scenarios:
  - Good morning conditions (should trigger alarm)
  - Weak morning winds (should not trigger alarm) 
  - Inconsistent wind direction
  - Wrong wind direction (opposite of preferred)
  - Few good consecutive data points

### Settings Screen

- Tap the "Settings" tab to access settings
- Adjust all wind criteria to match your activity needs
- Changes take effect immediately with real-time analysis update
- Reset to defaults with a single tap

### Wind Guru Tab

The enhanced **Wind Guru** tab provides revolutionary MKI wind prediction:

- **6-Factor MKI Analysis**: Complete atmospheric interaction assessment 
- **Live Probability Scoring**: Real-time percentage with confidence levels
- **Enhanced Factor Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of precipitation, sky, pressure, temperature, wave patterns, and stability
- **Mountain Wave Assessment**: Froude number analysis and wave enhancement potential

- **Advanced Insights**: Optimal time windows and detailed meteorological analysis with wave considerations

## Customizing Your Experience

Tailor the app to your specific needs through the Settings screen:

| Setting | Purpose | When to Adjust |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Minimum Wind Speed | Sets threshold for "Wake Up" decision | Increase for activities requiring stronger winds |
| Direction Consistency | Ensures wind direction stability | Higher values for activities requiring consistent direction |
| Consecutive Good Points | Requires sustained good conditions | Increase for more certainty, decrease for more alerts |
| Speed Variation | Controls acceptable gustiness | Lower for activities requiring stable wind speed |
| Direction Variation | Limits wind direction shifts | Lower for direction-sensitive activities |
