## Features

- **Morning Wind Alarm**: Wake up or sleep in based on actual wind conditions
- **Smart Analysis**: Uses 3am-5am window to analyze if conditions will be favorable
- **Verification System**: Confirms predictions using 6am-8am window data
- **Fully Configurable**: Customize all wind criteria to match your preferences
- **Standley Lake Monitor**: Monitor real-time wind conditions at Standley Lake (via Ecowitt weather stations)

## How It Works

The Dawn Patrol Alarm helps you decide when to head to the beach by analyzing early morning wind patterns at Soda Lake.

### Smart Wake-Up Decisions

1. **Morning Analysis**: The app checks wind conditions during the crucial 3am-5am window
2. **Decision Making**: Based on speed, consistency, and direction, it determines if conditions are favorable
3. **Clear Results**: Get a simple "Wake Up! ðŸŒŠ" or "Sleep In ðŸ˜´" recommendation with alarm
4. **Verification**: The app also checks the 6am-8am window to validate its predictions

### Default Settings (All Customizable)

- **Minimum Wind Speed**: 10 mph (good for most water activities)
- **Direction Consistency**: 70% (ensures reliable wind patterns)
- **Required Consecutive Points**: 4 (confirms sustained conditions)
- **Direction Variation Limit**: 45Â° (ensures consistent direction)

## Using the App

### Main Screen

- **Current Status**: Large "Wake Up! ðŸŒŠ" or "Sleep In ðŸ˜´" indicator
- **Wind Statistics**: View current speed, direction consistency, and quality metrics
- **Trend Chart**: See wind patterns over the last 12 hours
- **Manual Refresh**: Pull down to update wind data
- **Last Updated**: Time of most recent data fetch

### Alarm Tester

- **Test Different Scenarios**: Try different wind conditions to see how the alarm responds
- **Customize Parameters**: Adjust minimum wind speed, direction consistency, and other criteria
- **Real-time Feedback**: See immediate analysis results as you change settings
- **Audio Testing**: Test alarm sounds with volume control
- **Scenario Library**: Choose from pre-configured test scenarios:
  - Good morning conditions (should trigger alarm)
  - Weak morning winds (should not trigger alarm) 
  - Inconsistent wind direction
  - Wrong wind direction (opposite of preferred)
  - Few good consecutive data points

### Settings Screen

- Tap the "Settings" tab to access settings
- Adjust all wind criteria to match your activity needs
- Changes take effect immediately with real-time analysis update
- Reset to defaults with a single tap

## Customizing Your Experience

Tailor the app to your specific needs through the Settings screen:

| Setting | Purpose | When to Adjust |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Minimum Wind Speed | Sets threshold for "Wake Up" decision | Increase for activities requiring stronger winds |
| Direction Consistency | Ensures wind direction stability | Higher values for activities requiring consistent direction |
| Consecutive Good Points | Requires sustained good conditions | Increase for more certainty, decrease for more alerts |
| Speed Variation | Controls acceptable gustiness | Lower for activities requiring stable wind speed |
| Direction Variation | Limits wind direction shifts | Lower for direction-sensitive activities |
