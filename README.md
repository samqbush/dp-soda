## Wind Guru: Server-Based Predictions

**Enhanced Performance & Accuracy (In Development)**

The Wind Guru tab has been upgraded from a complex local prediction system to a server-based solution for improved performance and accuracy. Users will benefit from:

### Coming Soon: Server-Powered Features

**üåü Enhanced Prediction Capabilities:**
- **Machine Learning Models**: Advanced pattern recognition from comprehensive datasets
- **Real-Time Processing**: Continuous monitoring and instant prediction updates
- **Multi-Location Analysis**: Comparative analysis across multiple wind sites

## How It Works

The Dawn Patrol app helps you decide when to head to the beach by analyzing wind patterns at Soda Lake using multiple data sources and advanced meteorological models.

### Wind Monitoring

1. **Real-time Data**: The app continuously monitors wind conditions from multiple sources
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Uses historical patterns and current conditions to assess quality
3. **Visual Indicators**: Wind charts show your configurable threshold as a reference line
4. **Multiple Sources**: Combines government weather data with local weather stations

### Default Settings (All Customizable)

- **Minimum Wind Speed**: 15 mph (good for most water activities)
- **Direction Consistency**: 70% (ensures reliable wind patterns)
- **Required Consecutive Points**: 4 (confirms sustained conditions)
- **Direction Variation Limit**: 45¬∞ (ensures consistent direction)

## Using the App

### Main Screen

- **Current Conditions**: Real-time wind speed, direction, and quality metrics
- **Wind Charts**: Interactive charts showing recent wind patterns
- **Threshold Indicator**: Visual reference line based on your configured wind speed preference
- **Manual Refresh**: Pull down to update wind data
- **Last Updated**: Time of most recent data fetch

### Settings Screen

- **Test Different Scenarios**: Try different wind conditions to see how the alarm responds
- **Customize Parameters**: Adjust minimum wind speed, direction consistency, and other criteria
- **Real-time Feedback**: See immediate analysis results as you change settings
- **Audio Testing**: Test alarm sounds with volume control
- **Scenario Library**: Choose from pre-configured test scenarios:
  - Good morning conditions (should trigger alarm)
  - Weak morning winds (should not trigger alarm) 
  - Inconsistent wind direction
  - Wrong wind direction (opposite of preferred)
  - Few good consecutive data points

### Settings Screen

- Tap the "Settings" tab to access settings
- Adjust all wind criteria to match your activity needs
- Changes take effect immediately with real-time analysis update
- Reset to defaults with a single tap

### Wind Guru Tab

The enhanced **Wind Guru** tab provides revolutionary MKI wind prediction:

- **6-Factor MKI Analysis**: Complete atmospheric interaction assessment 
- **Live Probability Scoring**: Real-time percentage with confidence levels
- **Enhanced Factor Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of precipitation, sky, pressure, temperature, wave patterns, and stability
- **Mountain Wave Assessment**: Froude number analysis and wave enhancement potential
- **Visual MKI Indicators**: Color-coded probability bars and comprehensive condition status
- **Scientific Recommendations**: GO/MAYBE/SKIP guidance based on atmospheric research
- **Advanced Insights**: Optimal time windows and detailed meteorological analysis with wave considerations

## Customizing Your Experience

Tailor the app to your specific needs through the Settings screen:

| Setting | Purpose | When to Adjust |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Minimum Wind Speed | Sets threshold for "Wake Up" decision | Increase for activities requiring stronger winds |
| Direction Consistency | Ensures wind direction stability | Higher values for activities requiring consistent direction |
| Consecutive Good Points | Requires sustained good conditions | Increase for more certainty, decrease for more alerts |
| Speed Variation | Controls acceptable gustiness | Lower for activities requiring stable wind speed |
| Direction Variation | Limits wind direction shifts | Lower for direction-sensitive activities |

## Transmission Quality Monitoring

The app now includes advanced transmission quality monitoring to detect and warn users about antenna issues that can cause gaps in wind data:

### Transmission Quality Features

- **Antenna Issue Detection**: Automatically detects when weather stations are only transmitting indoor temperature/humidity due to antenna problems
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies periods where outdoor sensors (wind, temperature, humidity) are not transmitting
- **Status Indicators**: Shows current transmission status (Good, Partial, Indoor-only, Offline)
- **User Alerts**: Clear warnings when data gaps are caused by transmission issues, not weather conditions
- **Chart Context**: Explains gaps in wind speed charts so users understand they're caused by antenna issues, not lack of wind

### Transmission Status Types

- üü¢ **Good**: All sensors transmitting normally
- üü° **Partial**: Some sensors missing data
- üü† **Indoor-only**: Only indoor temperature/humidity transmitting (antenna issue)
- üî¥ **Offline**: No data being received

### Why This Matters

Weather stations can experience periodic antenna transmission problems that cause only indoor data to be transmitted while outdoor sensors (including wind) stop reporting. This creates gaps in wind charts that users might interpret as "no wind" when actually the station just couldn't transmit the data. The app now clearly distinguishes between these technical issues and actual weather conditions.
