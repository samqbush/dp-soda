# Katabatic Algorithm Calibration - Phase 2B

## Issue Report
**Date**: Today's Dawn Patrol Analysis  
**Problem**: Algorithm predicted only 60% probability when actual katabatic winds occurred during 6-8am window  
**Impact**: Algorithm is still too conservative, missing good conditions that users should be alerted to

## Root Cause Analysis
Despite previous improvements in Phase 2A, the algorithm remained overly conservative due to:

1. **Still-Restrictive Thresholds**: Mountain weather patterns don't always meet ideal textbook conditions
2. **Harsh Penalty System**: Factors close to meeting criteria were penalized too severely
3. **Limited Confidence Scoring**: Individual factor confidence calculations were too punitive
4. **Insufficient Bonus System**: Multi-factor favorable conditions weren't rewarded enough

## Phase 2B Improvements Implemented

### 1. Threshold Adjustments (More Realistic)
| Factor | Phase 2A | Phase 2B | Rationale |
|--------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Precipitation** | ≤20% | ≤25% | Light precip chance doesn't always kill katabatic |
| **Sky Conditions** | ≥60% clear | ≥45% clear | Mountain weather often has some clouds |
| **Pressure Change** | ≥1.5 hPa | ≥1.0 hPa | Smaller changes can still indicate good conditions |
| **Temperature Diff** | ≥4.0°C | ≥3.5°C | More sensitive to temperature differences |
| **Min Confidence** | 60% | 50% | Less conservative overall approach |

### 2. Penalty System Overhaul (Less Punitive)
| Factor | Phase 2A Penalty | Phase 2B Penalty | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Precipitation** | -40 points | -30 points | 25% reduction |
| **Sky Conditions** | -20 points | -15 points | 25% reduction |
| **Pressure Change** | -25 points | -20 points | 20% reduction |
| **Temperature** | -15 points | -10 points | 33% reduction |

### 3. Enhanced Confidence Scoring
- **Sky Conditions**: Minimum 20% confidence (was 0%), better scaling
- **Pressure Change**: Minimum 25% confidence (was 0%), improved sensitivity  
- **Temperature**: Minimum 30% confidence (was 0%), more generous scaling
- **All Factors**: Higher multipliers for good conditions

### 4. Improved Bonus System
- **3+ Factors Good**: 15% bonus (was 10%)
- **All 4 Factors Good**: 25% total bonus (was 15%)
- **NEW: Near Miss Bonus**: 5% bonus when 2+ factors are close to meeting criteria
- **Cumulative Effect**: Up to 30% total bonus possible

### 5. Algorithm Logic Improvements
- **Near Miss Detection**: Factors with high confidence but not quite meeting thresholds get partial credit
- **Minimum Confidence Floors**: Prevents factors from scoring 0% confidence
- **Scaling Improvements**: Better reward curves for good conditions

## Expected Impact

### Before Phase 2B
- **Actual Good Conditions**: 60% prediction (too conservative)
- **Marginal Conditions**: 30-40% predictions
- **Poor Conditions**: 10-20% predictions

### After Phase 2B (Expected)
- **Actual Good Conditions**: 75-90% predictions ✅
- **Marginal Conditions**: 45-65% predictions
- **Poor Conditions**: 15-35% predictions

## Technical Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. `/services/katabaticAnalyzer.ts` - Core algorithm improvements
2. `/hooks/useKatabaticAnalyzer.ts` - Updated default settings

### Key Code Changes
```typescript
// New thresholds
minCloudCoverClearPeriod: 45,     // was 60%
minPressureChange: 1.0,           // was 1.5 hPa
minTemperatureDifferential: 3.5,  // was 4.0°C
maxPrecipitationProbability: 25,  // was 20%

// Reduced penalties
skyConditions: confidence - 15    // was -20
pressureChange: confidence - 20   // was -25
precipitation: confidence - 30    // was -40
temperature: confidence - 10      // was -15

// Enhanced bonuses
if (factorsMet >= 3) baseScore *= 1.15; // was 1.10
if (factorsMet >= 4) baseScore *= 1.10; // was 1.05
// NEW: Near miss bonus for close factors
```

## Validation Plan

### Real-World Testing
1. **Monitor Predictions**: Track next 5 dawn patrol predictions vs actual conditions
2. **User Feedback**: Collect reports on prediction accuracy  
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Aim for 80%+ accuracy on good conditions
4. **Fine-Tuning**: Adjust further if needed based on results

### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: 75-90% predictions for actual good katabatic conditions
- **Secondary**: 50-65% predictions for marginal conditions  
- **Tertiary**: Maintain <35% predictions for poor conditions
- **Overall**: User satisfaction with prediction reliability

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: Algorithm improvements are now active
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track predictions vs actual conditions over next week
3. **Gather Feedback**: User reports on prediction accuracy
4. **Phase 2C**: Further adjustments if needed based on continued feedback

## Notes
- Algorithm now favors alerting users to potentially good conditions rather than missing them
- Conservative approach shifted from "rarely wrong" to "rarely miss good conditions"
- Maintains scientific rigor while adapting to real-world mountain weather patterns
