# Wind Guru Time-Based Analysis Fix

## Issue Fixed
The Wind Guru screen was continuously updating probability predictions throughout the day, even after the 6-8am dawn patrol window had passed. This made it impossible to verify prediction accuracy since the original prediction would change.

## Root Cause
The `useKatabaticAnalyzer` hook had auto-refresh mechanisms that triggered analysis every time weather data changed or every 30 minutes, regardless of the time of day. There was no distinction between:
- **Pre-dawn**: When predictions should be active
- **During dawn patrol**: When verification should occur  
- **Post-dawn patrol**: When analysis should be frozen for accuracy tracking

## Solution Implemented

### Time-Aware Analysis Modes
Added three distinct analysis modes based on current time:

#### ðŸ”® PREDICTION MODE (00:00 - 06:00)
- Active analysis for today's dawn patrol
- Uses forecast data for current day prediction  
- Updates every 30 minutes
- UI shows "Prediction mode"

#### âš¡ VERIFICATION MODE (06:00 - 08:00) 
- Real-time verification during dawn patrol window
- Compares predictions against actual conditions
- Continues updating to track accuracy
- UI shows "Real-time verification mode"

#### ðŸ”’ POST-DAWN MODE (08:00 - 23:59)
- **Freezes today's analysis** to preserve prediction accuracy
- Prevents continuous updates that would change the original prediction
- Focus shifts to tomorrow's forecast
- Auto-refresh disabled for today's prediction
- UI shows "Analysis frozen for accuracy tracking"

### Technical Changes

#### `hooks/useKatabaticAnalyzer.ts`
- Added `getAnalysisMode()` function to determine current time-based mode
- Implemented `timeAwareAnalyzeConditions()` that respects analysis modes
- Modified auto-refresh logic to skip updates in post-dawn mode
- Added analysis mode preservation logic

#### `app/(tabs)/wind-guru.tsx`
- Updated time status messages to reflect current analysis mode
- Added visual indicators (ðŸ”® PREDICTION, âš¡ LIVE, ðŸ”’ FROZEN)
- Added explanatory text when prediction is frozen
- Enhanced user understanding of when predictions update vs freeze

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Accurate Verification**: Can now see exactly what was predicted vs what actually happened
- **Clear Understanding**: UI clearly shows when predictions are active vs frozen
- **Better Planning**: Tomorrow's forecast available immediately after dawn patrol ends

### For Accuracy Tracking
- **Historical Data**: Preserves original predictions for verification
- **Pattern Recognition**: Enables learning from prediction accuracy over time
- **Confidence Calibration**: Users can understand which prediction levels work best

## Example Behavior

**Before 6am**: Shows updating prediction for today - "Dawn patrol starts in 2 hours - Prediction mode"

**6-8am**: Shows real-time verification - "Active Dawn Patrol Window - Real-time verification mode"  

**After 8am**: Shows frozen prediction - "Dawn patrol complete - Analysis frozen for accuracy tracking"
- Adds note: "Today's prediction is preserved for verification. Tomorrow's forecast available below."

## Testing Scenario
The reported issue where probability changed from 75% (last night) to 57% (today) would no longer occur. After 8am, the original 75% prediction would be preserved, allowing verification against actual Soda Lake conditions.
