# Documentation Instructions for Dawn Patrol Alarm

## Project Context
This is the Dawn Patrol Alarm repository for Soda Lake, Colorado - an Expo/React Native app that analyzes wind data to help users make dawn patrol decisions for wind sports.

## Documentation Standards

### Organization
- Store technical documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Keep README.md focused on user-facing information
- Avoid creating duplicate documentation
- Use clear, descriptive filenames

### Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples and code snippets
- Structure with meaningful headings and bullet points
- Reference actual file paths and component names from the codebase

### Technical Requirements
- Always verify file paths and code references are current
- Include version information for dependencies (especially React Navigation v7)
- Mark temporary debugging content for easy identification and removal
- Cross-reference related documentation to avoid duplication

### Maintenance
- Update documentation when making code changes
- Keep build and deployment instructions current
- Document troubleshooting scenarios and solutions
- Record breaking changes and migration steps

## File-Specific Guidelines

### README.md
- Focus on user installation and basic usage
- Include download links and getting started information
- Keep technical implementation details in docs/ files

### docs/ Files
- Provide comprehensive technical information
- Include troubleshooting and debugging guidance
- Document Android-specific issues and solutions
- Maintain current file structure documentation

## Common Tasks
- When adding new features, document their usage and configuration
- When fixing bugs, update troubleshooting documentation
- When modifying build processes, update relevant instruction files
- When changing file structure, update FILE_STRUCTURE.md

Always check the current state of files before updating and ensure consistency across all documentation.
The complete architecture is described in [ARCHITECTURE_AND_IMPLEMENTATION.md](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE_AND_IMPLEMENTATION.md).
