# Play Store Publishing Implementation (TODO)
# ==========================================
# To implement Google Play Store publishing, you'll need:
#
# 1. Set up a Google Play Developer account
# 2. Create a service account with appropriate permissions
# 3. Generate and store a JSON key as a GitHub secret (PLAY_STORE_CONFIG_JSON)
# 4. Install the necessary Android Publisher API credentials
#
# Example implementation using the google-github-actions/deploy-androidapp:
#
#      - name: 🚀 Publish to Play Store
#        uses: r0adkll/upload-google-play@v1
#        with:
#          serviceAccountJsonPlainText: ${{ secrets.PLAY_STORE_CONFIG_JSON }}
#          packageName: com.yourcompany.windtrendanalyzer
#          releaseFiles: artifacts/aab/app-release.aab
#          track: production  # or internal, alpha, beta
#          status: completed  # or draft, inProgress, halted
#          # changesNotSentForReview: true  # Use for minor updates
#          # userFraction: 0.5  # For staged rollouts
#          # mappingFile: mapping.txt  # For ProGuard mapping
