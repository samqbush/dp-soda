# White Screen Fix - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the "white screen" issue in the React Native Android app when running as a release build from GitHub Actions.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Error Handling & Recovery

- **Enhanced ErrorBoundary**: Added more robust error reporting and recovery options
- **Diagnostic Service**: Created a diagnostic tool to debug startup issues
- **Storage Services**: Added initialization and cleanup utilities for AsyncStorage

### 2. App Initialization Flow

- **Splash Screen Management**: Improved splash screen handling to prevent premature dismissal
- **Async Storage Initialization**: Added initialization checks and safe fallbacks
- **Build Config**: Added build configuration utilities for environment-specific debugging

### 3. Data and Cache Management

- **Improved Cache Validation**: Added cache validation and error-recovery for corrupt data
- **Sample Data Fallbacks**: Enhanced sample data generation for when API access fails
- **Resilient Data Processing**: Improved error handling in data processing pipeline

### 4. Deployment Configuration

- **Android Permissions**: Explicitly declared required permissions in app.json
- **Version Code**: Increased version code for clean installation
- **Configuration Values**: Added configuration values for more stable Android behavior

## How to Test

1. Build the app using the GitHub Actions workflow:
   - Let the workflow complete
   - Download the universal APK from the workflow artifacts

2. If you still encounter issues:
   - Use the "Run Diagnostics" button (if visible)
   - If the app doesn't start at all, try uninstalling and reinstalling
   - Check for any error logs in the GitHub Actions workflow output

## Common Issues & Solutions

### White Screen on Launch

This could be caused by:

1. **AsyncStorage initialization failure**: The app now has recovery mechanisms for this.
2. **API request failures**: The app now falls back to sample data if API requests fail.
3. **Cache corruption**: There's now automatic cache clearing in case of corrupt data.

### App Crashes After Launch

If the app crashes after showing UI:

1. Use the diagnostics feature to check for errors
2. Clear app data using the diagnostics tool
3. If all else fails, uninstall and reinstall the app

### Other Potential Issues

- **File storage problems**: These should be detected by the diagnostic tool
- **Network connectivity issues**: The app should now handle these more gracefully
- **Bundling issues**: The updated build process should address bundling issues

## Next Steps

If there are still issues after implementing these fixes:

1. Add more comprehensive logging to the GitHub Actions workflow
2. Implement crash reporting (e.g., with Firebase Crashlytics)
3. Consider using Expo EAS instead of raw GitHub Actions for more reliable builds
