 * explicit that it must be written down and not changed midway. If you are tempted to tweak it,
 * add a NEW named label instead and report both.
 *
 * AMENDED from the §7 proposal. The original read:
 *
 *     "did Soda sustain >=15 mph for >=30 continuous minutes between 05:00 and 08:00?"
 *
 * That counts mornings the user could not physically have ridden. The Bear Creek Lake Park gate
 * does not open until 08:00 in Nov–Feb and 07:00 in Mar/Apr/Oct (§4.5), so a morning blowing
 * 20 mph at 05:00 and dead by 06:00 scored as a positive despite being unreachable. Training on
 * that answers "did a rideable window exist somewhere" rather than "will I get a session if I
 * drive out now" — different questions, different conditional distributions.
 *
 * The label is therefore gate-conditioned: the qualifying window must lie ENTIRELY after gate
 * open. This lowers the measured base rate below §4.6's ~13%, which is the point.
