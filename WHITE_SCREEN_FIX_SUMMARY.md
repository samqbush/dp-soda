# White Screen Fix Implementation Summary

## Problem
The Wind Trend Analyzer app was experiencing a white screen issue on Android when installing the .apk from GitHub Actions. The app would briefly display content (showing the splash screen and initial UI) before crashing to a white screen.

## Root Causes
1. **Memory Management Issues**: Poor handling of AsyncStorage data leading to cache corruption
2. **Unhandled Errors**: Inadequate error handling during app initialization and data loading
3. **Race Conditions**: Issues during component initialization and state management
4. **Splash Screen Handling**: Problems with Android-specific splash screen transitions

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Memory Management
Created a comprehensive memory management system:
- `memoryManager.ts`: Provides functions to clean up memory and trim large caches
- Automatic memory cleanup during app initialization and lifecycle transitions
- Added cache size monitoring with automatic trimming when exceeds thresholds

### 2. Enhanced Error Recovery
Implemented a robust recovery service:
- `recoveryService.ts`: Provides granular recovery options for different error scenarios
- Multi-tiered recovery approach (basic → aggressive → full reset)
- Preservation of critical user settings during recovery

### 3. Improved State Management
Added more stable state handling:
- `useStableState.ts`: Prevents race conditions and provides more reliable state updates
- Safeguards against closure issues and stale state references
- Automatic detection of state corruption scenarios

### 4. Component Safety
Enhanced critical components with error protection:
- `SafeDataWrapper.tsx`: Protects data-heavy components from rendering crashes
- Added error boundary enhancements to handle more error types
- Implemented component-level error recovery in `WindDataDisplay`

### 5. Android-Specific Optimizations
Added targeted fixes for Android:
- `AndroidSafeWrapper.tsx`: Provides recovery mechanisms specific to Android
- `androidSplash.ts`: Improved splash screen handling with multiple fallbacks
- Enhanced build process with memory optimization flags

### 6. Build Process Improvements
Modified GitHub Actions workflow:
- Added memory optimization flags to Gradle configuration
- Created build-specific configuration for runtime detection of build info
- Improved Android resource handling during build

## Files Modified
1. `/hooks/useStableState.ts` (new)
2. `/hooks/useWindData.ts`
3. `/services/memoryManager.ts` (new)
4. `/services/recoveryService.ts` (new)
5. `/services/androidSplash.ts`
6. `/components/SafeDataWrapper.tsx` (new)
7. `/components/AndroidSafeWrapper.tsx`
8. `/components/WindDataDisplay.tsx`
9. `/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
10. `/app/_layout.tsx`
11. `/.github/workflows/build.yml`

## Testing Strategy
We've implemented a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the fixes are effective:
1. Clean install of the .apk from GitHub Actions
2. Multiple background/foreground transitions to test lifecycle handling
3. Testing under memory pressure conditions
4. Recovery testing after simulated crashes

## Documentation
Added detailed documentation to explain the changes and provide guidance for future development:
1. `/docs/WHITE_SCREEN_FIX.md`
2. `/docs/WHITE_SCREEN_FIX_GUIDE.md`

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider implementing Firebase Crashlytics for better error reporting
2. Evaluate switching to Expo EAS for more reliable Android builds
3. Add proactive diagnostics to detect and prevent potential issues
